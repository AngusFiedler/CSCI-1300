/**
* Algorithm: Finds what doors, if any, will open inside of a minivan
*   1. initializes a bool for left door and right door and sets them both to false
    2. Checks if the car is in park and if the masterlock is false
        3. checks if the left door would open,
            sets leftdoor to true 
        4.checks if the right door would open
            sets right door to open
    5. checks if left and right door are true
        prints both doors will open
    6. else checks if just right door is true
        prints right door opens
    7. else checks if just left door is true
        prints left door opens
    8. else
        prints both doors remain closed
* Parameters:  bool dashSL, bool dashSR, bool childLock, bool masterLock, bool insideLL, bool outsideLL, bool insideRL, bool outsideRL, char gearShift
* Output: Both doors open, left door opens, right door opens, or both doors stay close 
* Returns: None
