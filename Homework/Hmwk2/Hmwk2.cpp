/*
*This function takes a given int value which is named seconds and computes the time in hours min and seconds
*It does this by:
    1. Calculates the hours by dividing the input(seconds) by the amount of seconds in an hour(60*60)
    2. Calculats the time in min by diving the input(seconds) by the amount of seconds in a min (60) then subtracts the amount already found in hours
    3. Calculates the remaining seconds by taking the inital input and subtracting the minutes found * 60 and the hours found*60*60
    4. Outputs the values of hours, min, and seconds.
    
*Input parameters: seconds(int type)
*Output: diffrent string based on the hours, min, and seconds calculated
   x hour(s) y minute(s) z second(s)
*Returns: Nothing

*This function takes a given temp in celsius and converts it into fahrenheit 
*Algorithm does this by:
    1. Multiplies the input(int celsius) by 9/5ths and adds 32
    2. Prints the output to the screen
*Input parameters: temputure in celsius(int type)
*Output: String based on inputed temp in celsius and its converted temp in fahrenheit
    The temperature of x in fahrenheit is y
*Returns: Nothing

/*
*This function calculates the future population of the US given the current population as well as birth rate, death rate, and immigration rate
*Algorithm does this by:
    1.sets the values for birth rate, death rate, and immigration rate
    2. sets an int of minutes in a year to 365*24*60 
    3. calculates the new population by taking (60/birthrate)*the minutes in a year and doing the same with immigration rate and adding the current population then subtracting (60.0/DR)*MinInYear
    4. returns the new population 
*Input parameters: currentPop(int type)
*Output: None
*Returns: The newPopulation(int type)

/*
*This function calculates the luminosity of an astronomical object given its distance and brightness
*Algorithm does this by:
    1. Setting the value of pi to the double, pi
    2. Calculates the value of luminosity by the given formula
    3. Casts the value obtained in previous step from a double into an int
    4. returns the luminosity(int type)
