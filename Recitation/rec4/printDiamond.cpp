/**
* Algorithm: Prints a diamond patern with the side lengths given
*   1. set space counter to length -1
*   2. First print the first half of the diamond
*       1. While my innerCounter is less than my space counter add a space, add 1 to innercounter
*       2. Subtract 1 from the space counter
*       3. Another While loop, while the innerCounter is less than or equal to 2 times the counter -1
*           1.print a "*"
*           2. add 1 to the inner counter
*       4. Go to the next line
    3. Print the second half of the diamond, same steps just more and more spaces instead of less
* Parameters:  a side length (int type)
* Output: a diamond patern based on given side length
* Returns: Nothing
