/**
* Algorithm: Calculates if a year is a leap year 
*   1. Initilizes bool leapYear to false
    2. if year is less than 1582 and has no remainder if divded by 4 changes leapYear to true
    3. Else if the year is divisible by 4 with no remainder and it has a remainder or the year divided by 400 has no remainder
        changes leap year to true;
    4.Returns the value of leapYear
* Parameters:  year(int type)
* Output: None
* Returns: leapYear (bool type) 1 if it is a leap year, 0 if it is not
