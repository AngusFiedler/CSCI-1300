/**
* Algorithm: Calculates weekly pay given payrate and number of hours worked 
*   1. Checks if both hours worked and pay rate is positive
        2.if hours worked is less than 40, calculates hours worked times pay rate and returns the value
        3.if hours worked is over 40 calculates the pay for the first 40 hours and stores it as pay
        4.changes pay equal to pay + (hoursworked - 40)*payrate*1.5 to find the overtime pay added to base pay
        5.returns the total pay
    2.returns -1 if either payrate or hours worked is negative
* Parameters:  hoursWorked (type double), payrate(type double)
* Output: None
* Returns: the total pay (type double)
