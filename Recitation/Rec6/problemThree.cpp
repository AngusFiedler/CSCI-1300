/*
    initilize counter, count and start to zero
    for each time the delim is found at the beginning of the string
        add one to the starting point
    for each char in the split string
        if the delim is found at split[i]
            store(counter) = the substring from start to current pos
            counter +1
            while split[i+1] is equal to delim
                i++
            set start to i + 1
            set count equal to the counter, this is not the most efficient way of doing this
        else 
            count = -1
    return count
